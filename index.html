	<h1>Secessionism in Budapest</h1>

<div id="page">
  
	  <h2>Origin of Secessionism in Architecture</h2>
	  <p class="description">Secession is an art movement, closely related to Art Nouveau, that was formed in 1897 by a group of Austrian painters, graphic artists, sculptors and architects, 
       including Josef Hoffman, Koloman Moser, Otto Wagner and Gustav Klimt. 
       They resigned from the Association of Austrian Artists in protest against its support for more traditional artistic styles.
       Hungarian Secession is the most original among all the variants of Art Nouveau. This assessment is largely based on the œuvre of one architect: Ödön Lechner. 
       His work shows a strong influence of traditional Hungarian architecture as well as of various cultures of the Orient. This makes Hungarian Art Nouveau look clearly less European than 
       its counterparts in Vienna, Brussels, and Paris.</p>
